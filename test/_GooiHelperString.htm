    Stuff in the helper library are meant to be things 
    that use prototype against their respective native
    types to take over functionality. Like our string.write
    function. Some caution should be practiced, we don't 
    want to go hog wild.
    
    EcmaCompatibility is very similar to helpers, in so 
    far as it should get immediately exectued and will 
    add itself via prototype to its native object. Yet 
    its intended usage is different, EC is used to get
    the Browser JavaScript version up to 1.8 (for some 
    things) whereas Helpers add new functionality onto
    navtive types.
